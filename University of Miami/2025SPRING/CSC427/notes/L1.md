# Finite Automaton

### Definition
A finite automaton is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta, q_{0},F)$
1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**
3. $\delta:Q\times \Sigma\to Q$ is the **transition function**
4. $q_{0}\in Q$ in the **start state**
5. $F\subseteq Q$ is the **set of accept states**


### Language

$\Sigma^0=\{\epsilon\}$ 

The set of string with only one character
$\Sigma^1=\{a, b, c, \dots\}$
